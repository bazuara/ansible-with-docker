Welcome to your first exercise!
In this level, ypu ar going to learn to connect and install software from the captains ship to a Bajovnick type starfighter.
--Bajovnick lore goes here--
These are the steps you are going to need to reproduce:

	* Connect to your captains console (ssh ender@localhost -p 8022) Remember, your ultra secure
	  military-grade encrypted user:password is ender:ender
	* Generate your captains credentials (ssh-key-gen).
	* Send your credentials to the commanded ships (ssh-copy-id).
	* Test secure connections (ssh-without a password).
	* As the Bajovnick class ships are mainly communications ships, you need to command the ship to
	  relay and broadcast information signals (Install and start an nginx server)
	* To end your first assignment, you need to communicate the proper message as
	  an international fleet officer (link the /sample/index.html to /var/www/index.html)
	* Check everything is ok and destroy everything after
