## Learn ansible with docker

![](./srcs/png_internationalfleet_logo.png)

(Read with Mazer RackhamÂ´s voice)

Welcome to the International Fleet officer trainer simulator! Where we thin out the future officers from the herd! We will prepare you to send commands across the galaxy to multiple starfigthers at the same time, to defeat those formic b#stards!

(Lore will continue)

This labs consists of two kinds of containers:

 * ansible_philote: To give commands
 * Starships: To receive commands across the galaxy

To start run in a terminal window:

``` 
bash ./launcher.sh
```
And follow the on-screen instructions.

In every ansible commander machine, the persisten folder will be /etc/ansible, and it will be stored outside the containers, in your local file etc_ansible/lvl*
